This is a solution for Polish Physics Olympiad's problem. The Agent has to deliver a package from point A to B, but in the middle of the AB segment (in point C) there are radiation source. Determine (accurate to within 50 m) the radius of a circle, on which Agent absorb least dose.

(The graph could generate for a while)
